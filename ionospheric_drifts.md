## The vertical plasma drift


### Vertical drift outside the magnetic equator

In this case, we need to consider the meridional wind since this component may
contribute to the vertical plasma motion as well [Nogueira et al., (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jastp.2011.02.008):

$$V_{ap} = V_D \cdot \cos I \pm U_F \cdot \cos I \sin I - w_D \cdot sin^2 I,$$

where $V_D$ is the vertical drift velocity computed as $\Delta h / \Delta t$, $I$ is 
the magnetic inclination  angle, $U_F$ is the meridional wind component in the F region 
(positive northward), $w_D$ is the contribution to the vertical plasma velocity due to 
diffusion, which is given by $w_D = g/\nu_i$, $g$ being the gravity acceleration, and 
$\nu_i$ is the ion‚Äêneutral collision frequency.
