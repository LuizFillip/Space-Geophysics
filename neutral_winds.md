# WINDS IN THE THERMOSPHERE

Thermospheric neutral winds play an important role in the latitudinal configuration of the EIA. The latitudinal distribution of ionospheric plasma is modified by ion-neutral collisional drag, which transports ionization along magnetic field lines following the meridional wind. This latitudinal plasma distribution results in an interhemispheric transport of ionization. Thus, the EIA may present an asymmetry between the two crests with reference to the EIA valley.

The thermospheric neutral wind has meridional, zonal, and vertical components. Thermospheric winds are influenced by the coriolis force due to Earth’s rotation. Apart from this, the winds are also a↵ected by the frictional forces due to the viscosity of the air and by the collisions of neutrals with the ambient ions.

### THERMOSPHERIC WINDS MODIFICATION 

In region with high magnetic declination, the effective wind ($U_{ef}$), which is the same as the meridional magnetic wind along the magnetic field line, has the contribution of the zonal and meridional components of the neutral wind. Thus, the effective winds can ne calculated by as:


$$U_{ef} = \left(U_\phi \cos D + U_\phi \sin D \right) \cos I $$

Where, $U_\phi$ is the geographic meridional component of the eastward wind), $U_\theta$ is the magnetic declination angle and $D$ is the inclination angle (positive to north), $I$ is the zonal geographic component of the wind (positive magnetic, i.e., the dip angle. According to the expression above, it can be seen that the $U_{ef}$ is the projection of the meridional magnetic wind to the along the magnetic field lines.
