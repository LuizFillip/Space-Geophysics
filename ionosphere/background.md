# The Ionosphere

<ol> 
 - The ionosphere is the region of the upper atmosphere where the Sun's ultraviolet radiation can ionize oxygen molecules to create a positive ion and a free electron. So, It is the region where plasma density is maximum, extending from 60 to 1000 km above the surface of the earth.

- The ionosphere organizes itself into regions or "layers". Theses layers varies with strength density of ionization with altitude under different processes od production and loss.

## History

<ol>  
   - Hertz demonstrated that the direction of travel of an electromagnetic wave can be altered by an electrically conductive obstacle. 
   - in 1901 Maconi heard transmissions in Newfoundland from Poldhu (England) 
   - In 1902 Kennelly (US) and Heaviside (Great Britain) suggested independently that the Earth's upper atmosphere consisted of an electrically conductive region 
         -  
           - In 1925 Russel proposed the name Kennelly-Heaviside layer.  
           - In 1926 Watson-Watt introduced the term "ionosphere". 
         
   - In 1924 Appleton found conclusive evidence of an electrically conductive 
    region by measuring the angle of arrival of radio waves from a nearby transmitter. 
   - In 1925 Breit and Tuve demonstrated the existence in a more striking way .
         - 
           - They transmitted short burts of energy straight up and measured 
            the delay of the return echo .
           - Later they varied the frequency of the transmitted pulses and 
            noted that above a certain "Critical frequency" the reion would no 
            longer return an echo .
           - This was the first documented use of a vertical incidence 
            ionospheric sounder (ionosonde)</li>
         
   -The work of breit and tuve opended the doors</li>
   - Swept-frequency ionosondes develeped 
   - Lots of military interest in the ionosphere during WW2 .
   - International Geophysical Year (IGY) from July 1957 - 
    December 1958 performed worldwide measurements of the ionosphere. 
   - Data from worldwide ionosondes allowed 
    develeopment of model of E and F regions .

## Ionosphere layers

### D-layer

<font size="3"> 
<ol>    
 - About <b>50 - 100 km</b> altitude 
 &emsp;   
 - <b> Production </b> 
     - 
       - Daytime ionization of nitric oxide (NO) by solar Lyman alpha (121 nm) 
        and nitrogen and oxygen ($N_2$, $O_2$) by solar X-rays (less than 20 nm). 
        Molecular ions react with water vapor to produce water cluster ions.     
     
 - <b> Loss </b> 
     - 
       -Electrons recombine rapidly with water cluster ions and also attach 
        to molecules to make negative ions (but rapidly detach again in daylight). 
     
    
 - <b> Balance </b> 
     - 
       -Region disappers at night (within several minutes) as production 
        essentially ceases and electrons undergo rapid recombination and attachment. 
       - Rapidly disappers at sunset; 
       - Rapidly re-forms at sunrise. 
     
    
 - Absorbs long wavelenght <b>radio waves.</b> 
         -  
           - 160, 80 and 40 meters  
         
 </ol> </font>


### E - Layer

<ol> 
 - about <b>100-140 km </b> altitude. 
 &emsp;  
<li><b> Production </b> 
     - 
   -Daytime ionization of molecular oxygen ($O_2$) by EUV radiation (90 - 130 nm),
     ionization of meteoric vapors .
     

<li><b> Loss </b></li>
     - 
   - Electrons recombine with molecular ions ($O_2^+$ and $NO^+$)
     
   
 - <b> Banlace </b> 
     - 
   - Layer persists, although diminishes, during night due to slower recombination
     (than in D-region) and presence of atomic metalic ions such as $Na^+$ (sodium) and $Fe^+$ (iron).
      Electrons recombine with atomic ions (such as $Na^+$ or $O^+$) very inefficiently .
   - Similar to D-Region 
   - Less absortion 
         -   
           - 10m, 6m and 2m</li>
         
     
 - E region behaves as a Chapman layer.   
 - Auroral propagation .
 - Sporadic - E skip</li>
     - 
       - At the E region height sporadic thin layers can be formed that can
         have electron densities well above the background values. 
     
    
</ol>


### F Layer

<ol> 
 - <b>Production </b></li>
     -  
       - daytime ionization of atomic $O$ by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) solar radiation 
        (20 - 90 nm). $O^+$ converted to $NO^+$ by molecular nitrogen ($N_2$) 
       - Can remain ionized all night 
       - Variations depend on local time, latitude, longitude, season, solar cycle, 
        geomagnetic activity, and electrodynamic conditions</li>
     

 - Splits into <b>two regions</b> during the day 

 - Long-range HF propagation 
</ol>


#### F1 layer

<ol>
 - About <b>140 to 200 km </b> altitude. 
    
<li><b>Loss </b></li>
     -  
       - Controlled by recombination of $NO^+$ ions with electrons .
     
<li><b>Balance </b></li>
     -  
       - Layer diminishes at night as electrons recomibine with $NO^+$ .
         
        
 - F1 region bahaves as a Chapman layer 
</ol>


#### F2 layer

<ol>
 - Peak about <b>300 to 400 km</b> altitude. 
<li><b>Loss </b></li>
     -  
       - Controlled by $O^+$ reaction with molecular nitrogen ($N_2$), eletrons recombine quickly with ion prduct ($NO^+$) as it is created .
     
<li><b>Balance </b></li>
     -  
       - Region persists through night (becoming simply the F-region) since
         the small supply of $N_2$ leads to slow conversion od $O^+$ to $NO^+$ and 
         hence only a small reduction in the number of electron .
         
 - Transport processes become important in the $F_2$ and upper F regions, 
incluing ambipolar diffusion and wind-induced drifts along $\mathbf{B}$, and 
electrodynamic drifts across $\mathbf{B}$. 
</ol>

The recomination process in F2 layer occurs in two-stage:

$$ O^+ N_2 \rightarrow NO^+ + N ~\text{(attachment like)}$$

 - rate $\propto \beta~ [O^+]$ 
 - Controls the rate at high altitudes 

$$ NO^+ + e \rightarrow N + O $$

 - rate $\propto \alpha~ [NO^+][N_e]$ 
 - Controls the rate at low altitudes 

$$ \frac{dn_e}{dt} = q_{\nu, e} - \alpha_r n_e^2 - \beta_r n_e$$
