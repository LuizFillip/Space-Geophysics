# PREREVERSAL ENHANCEMENT (PRE)

For stations located outside the magnetic equator, like BV, we need to consider 
the meridional wind since this component may contribute to the vertical plasma
motion as well [Nogueira et al., (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jastp.2011.02.008):

$$V_{ap} = V_D \cdot \cos I \pm U_F \cdot \cos I \sin I - w_D \cdot sin^2 I,$$
